    <h3>The making of a Lasagna!!!</h3>
    <p>
      This easy pizza dough recipe is great for beginners and produces a soft
      homemade pizza crust. Skip the pizza delivery because you only need 6
      basic ingredients to begin!

      <li>
        <strong>Make the dough:</strong> Mix the dough ingredients together by
        hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in
        the written recipe below.
      </li>

        <strong>Knead:</strong>
        Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rise:</strong> Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover
        tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the
        refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Punch & shape:</strong>Punch down risen dough to release air
        bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and
        rest as you prep the pizza toppings.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Top it:</strong>Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake:</strong>Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only
        about 15 minutes.

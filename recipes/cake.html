          >Dry ingredients in one bowl, wet ingredients in another:</strong
        >
        I like to whisk my dry ingredients together in one bowl until they are
        well blended. Then I whisk all the wet ingredients together in another
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fold the dry and wet ingredients together:</strong>
        Then I switch to a rubber spatula or large spoon and fold the two — wet
        and dry ingredients — together until I don't see any large streaks of
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add carrots, nuts, and raisins:</strong> When I've got the
        batter ready, I fold in the carrots, and if I'm using them, the nuts and
        raisins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >To bake the carrot cake, divide the batter between two buttered and
          floured cake pans and bake until done. The cake layers bake in the
          oven for 35 to 40 minutes (they smell fantastic). After baking, let
          the layers cool then frost with your favorite frosting.</strong
